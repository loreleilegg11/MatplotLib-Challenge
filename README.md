# MatplotLib-Challenge
Module 5 Challenge
Used course resources and videos to complete the challenge. I also consulted Xpert learning assistant. I had to use (numeric_only=True) for the mean, median, variance and SEM to compute correctly. 
I utilized matplotlib functions to create a scatterplot, bar graphs, pie charts, and a box plot. I also used tools to better tailor the graphs and change colors, sizes, and overall format.
